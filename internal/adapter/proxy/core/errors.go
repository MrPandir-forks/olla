// failover-eligible but must NOT route it through the connection-error path,
// which would 1-strike-demote the endpoint's persisted health: a breaker-open
// rejection reflects the breaker's accumulated state, not a fresh connectivity
// failure, so demoting here would double-count and corrupt health tracking.
