# Admin Dashboard

Olla ships with a read-only, single-page dashboard at `/internal/ui/`, embedded in the
binary and served on the same listener as the proxy. It answers "is my fleet healthy",
"which backend is slow" and "which models are loaded where" at a glance, without
`curl`-ing `/internal/status*` and reading JSON.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Read-only** | No config editing, no endpoint control. Nothing in it changes state. |
| **Polled** | Fetches the same `/internal/status*` JSON as the CLI on a 5-15s cycle, with `ETag`/`304` caching and gzip. No WebSocket, no push. |
| **Same listener** | Shares `server.host` and `server.port` with the proxy. No second port, no separate TLS posture. |
| **No authentication** | Access control is network-layer only. See [Security model](#security-model). |

## Getting there

With the shipped default config, start Olla and open:

```text
http://localhost:40114/internal/ui/
```

The trailing slash matters: the SPA is mounted at that exact prefix and loads its assets
relative to it. `localhost` is in the default `allowed_hosts`, and an IP-literal Host
such as `127.0.0.1` is always accepted, so both work out of the box. A hostname not
listed in `allowed_hosts` is rejected, even if it resolves to an allowed IP.

## The three panels

| Panel | What it shows | Backed by | Poll interval |
|-------|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| Overview | Fleet status, success rate, average latency, traffic, connections, requests, failures, security violations, uptime, engine/balancer in use, and a live requests-per-second sparkline | `GET /internal/status` | 5s |
| Endpoints | Per-endpoint name, type, status, priority, success rate, latency (avg/min/max), request count, connections, model count, health check timing, sanitised URL | `GET /internal/status/endpoints` | 5s |
| Models | Model inventory grouped by family: name, aliases, parameter size, quantisation, size on disk, hosting endpoints, last seen | `GET /internal/status/models` | 15s |

Clicking a model's host jumps to that endpoint's row in the Endpoints panel. The active
panel and any selected endpoint live in the URL hash, so refreshes and shared links
restore the same view. The theme follows the browser's light/dark preference, with a
toggle to override it.

Polling is jittered so multiple open tabs don't fire in lockstep, backs off while the
tab is hidden, and flags a panel as stale when its data is older than expected.

Two columns are deliberately absent: circuit-breaker state (the breaker only trips on
health probes, so it would under-report live failures) and per-model traffic (the proxy
engines don't record per-model counts).

The frontend targets current evergreen browsers; older browsers are untested. Building
the SPA is covered in [Development Setup](../development/setup.md#optional-bun-11-for-the-admin-dashboard).

## Configuration

The shipped default enables the dashboard with a loopback-only access policy:

```yaml
dashboard:
  enabled: true
  access_policy:
    allowed_cidrs:
      - "127.0.0.0/8"
      - "::1/128"
    allowed_hosts:
      - "localhost"
  gate_internal_api: false
```

`enabled: false` is a genuine off switch: no `/internal/ui/*` routes are registered and
requests get the default `404`, so the mount point is not discoverable when disabled.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `dashboard.enabled` | bool | `true` | Whether `/internal/ui/*` routes are registered |
| `dashboard.access_policy.allowed_cidrs` | []string | `["127.0.0.0/8", "::1/128"]` | CIDR allowlist matched against the TCP source address. Must be non-empty when enabled |
| `dashboard.access_policy.allowed_hosts` | []string | `["localhost"]` | Hostname allowlist matched against the `Host` header (port stripped, case-insensitive). May be empty: IP-literal Hosts are always accepted |
| `dashboard.gate_internal_api` | bool | `false` | Reserved for a future release that extends `access_policy` to the rest of `/internal/*`. Inert today: setting it `true` logs a startup warning and changes nothing |

Startup fails if `allowed_cidrs` is empty or a CIDR does not parse.

!!! warning "Nest fields under `access_policy`, not directly under `dashboard`"

    Olla silently drops unknown config keys. If you put `allowed_cidrs` directly under
    `dashboard:` instead of `dashboard.access_policy:`, Olla falls back to the
    loopback-only default without complaint, and you find out when access is refused.

## Widening access

### LAN access

Add the client subnet, plus any non-IP hostname you will type into the browser:

```yaml
dashboard:
  enabled: true
  access_policy:
    allowed_cidrs:
      - "127.0.0.0/8"
      - "::1/128"
      - "10.0.1.0/24"
    allowed_hosts:
      - "olla.internal.example.net"
  gate_internal_api: false
```

Browsing by IP (`http://10.0.1.5:40114/internal/ui/`) needs no `allowed_hosts` entry;
browsing by hostname does.

### Docker

The published image ships ready to go: it binds `0.0.0.0` and the dashboard's
`allowed_cidrs` is pre-widened to the private ranges (`10.0.0.0/8`,
`172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`), so a request arriving through a published
port - which comes from the Docker bridge gateway, not loopback - is accepted.
The dashboard loads with no extra configuration:

```bash
docker run -p 40114:40114 ghcr.io/thushan/olla:latest
# then open http://localhost:40114/internal/ui/
```

```yaml
services:
  olla:
    image: ghcr.io/thushan/olla:latest
    ports:
      - "40114:40114"
    # No volume required for the dashboard. Mount one only to customise the
    # config; it lands at the first path in Olla's config search order, so it
    # overrides the baked-in container defaults.
    # volumes:
    #   - ./olla.local.yaml:/app/config/config.local.yaml:ro
```

The Host check is unchanged, so reaching the container by a non-IP hostname (from
another compose service, or via a DNS name on your LAN) still needs that name in
`allowed_hosts`. `localhost` and any IP literal work as shipped.

!!! tip "Getting a 403 in Docker?"

    That may happen when you mount a config whose `allowed_cidrs` is still
    loopback-only. The 403 body names the source IP and Host Olla saw: `172.17.0.1`
    on native Linux Docker, something in `10.0.0.0/8` on Docker Desktop. Add that
    subnet - confirm it with `docker network inspect bridge` - to `allowed_cidrs`.
    Do not reach for
    `allowed_cidrs: ["0.0.0.0/0"]`, which opens the dashboard to anyone who can
    reach the listener.

## Security model

The dashboard has no authentication, consistent with the rest of `/internal/*`. The
access policy is the only control, enforced per request. Binding the listener to
loopback is not an alternative: the proxy legitimately binds `0.0.0.0` (the shipped
`config.yaml` does), and the dashboard shares that listener.

### The two checks

Every request must pass both; failure returns `403 Forbidden`.

1. **Client IP within `allowed_cidrs`.** The IP is the TCP source address.
   `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP` are never consulted, under any configuration.
2. **`Host` header parses as an IP literal, or matches `allowed_hosts`** (port stripped,
   case-insensitive). Any Host that parses as an IP literal is accepted unconditionally,
   whatever address it names - it is not checked against the connection's actual
   destination. This check exists to block DNS-rebinding-style hostnames, not to bind
   the request to a specific IP; `allowed_cidrs` is the real security boundary. A
   non-IP Host is rejected unless listed.

A failed check returns a body naming what failed and what Olla saw, with a matching
`Warn` log line:

```text
403 forbidden: ip not in allowed range (ip=172.17.0.1, host=172.17.0.1:40114)
403 forbidden: host not accepted (ip=10.0.1.5, host=olla.corp.example:40114)
```

### Scope and limits

- **The gate covers `/internal/ui/` only.** The JSON endpoints the dashboard reads
  (`/internal/status*`, `/internal/health`, `/internal/metrics`, `/version`) stay as
  reachable as they already were; gating the UI does not gate the data it renders.
  `gate_internal_api` is reserved to close that gap in a future release.
- **Anyone inside `allowed_cidrs` with an accepted Host can read the dashboard.**
  Widening the CIDR is a deliberate trade of exposure for convenience.
- **The container image ships that trade already made.** Its `allowed_cidrs` covers
  the private ranges so the dashboard works through a published port, which also
  admits anyone on the same LAN. Mount a config narrowing it to the bridge subnet
  if the host sits on an untrusted network.

!!! warning "A reverse proxy on the same host defeats the loopback check"

    If nginx, Caddy or Traefik forwards to Olla over `127.0.0.1`, every request arrives
    from loopback, including public internet traffic. The dashboard never trusts
    `X-Forwarded-For`, so there is no config fix: put your access control
    (authentication, ACLs) at the reverse proxy.

!!! warning "Permissive CORS exposes the status JSON"

    With `allowed_origins: ["*"]`, any website a visitor's browser is on can `fetch()`
    the `/internal/*` JSON cross-origin. The dashboard's own gate still applies to
    `/internal/ui/`, but the data behind it is readable regardless. Do not pair
    permissive CORS with an ungated `/internal/*`.

## Troubleshooting

After changing `dashboard.*`, restart Olla and check from the same host:

```bash
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:40114/internal/ui/
```

| Response | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `200` | Dashboard mounted and the policy admits you |
| `403` | Policy refused the request. The body names the failed check and the IP and Host Olla saw, so you can add the missing `allowed_cidrs` or `allowed_hosts` entry |
| `404` | Routes not registered: `dashboard.enabled: false` |
| `503` | Binary was built without the SPA. Run `make build-web` (see [Development Setup](../development/setup.md#optional-bun-11-for-the-admin-dashboard)) |
