# Release Notes

This page tracks notable additions, fixes, and breaking changes in Olla. Each entry
is written for an operator upgrading from a prior release: what changed, why, and the
exact migration step if a behaviour change affects you.

Breaking changes are tagged **Breaking**. Additions and fixes are tagged **Added** or
**Fixed**. Quoted field names and config keys are the literal wire or YAML identifiers.

## v0.0.29

### Breaking: userinfo URLs now fail startup

An endpoint URL with embedded `user:pass@host` is rejected at config load. Previously
such a URL loaded silently and the credentials flowed into every status/dashboard JSON
surface as the literal URL string. The endorsed credential path is the `auth:` block,
which is held as `json:"-"` fields on the internal endpoint record and never reaches the
status layer.

**Before:**

```yaml
- url: "http://user:pass@host:8080"
  name: "protected-backend"
  type: "openai-compatible"
```

**After:**

```yaml
- url: "http://host:8080"
  name: "protected-backend"
  type: "openai-compatible"
  auth:
    type: basic
    username: user
    password: pass
```

For secrets kept out of config, use the `username_file` / `password_file` variants (see
[Endpoint Authentication](../configuration/endpoint-auth.md)).

The boot error rewrites the rejected URL into an `auth:` block with the credentials
replaced by placeholders, so the fix is a copy-paste away without the error ever echoing
your real credentials. For a full `user:pass@host` URL this is an exactly equivalent
basic block; for a username-only `user@host` URL there is no equivalent basic
configuration (basic auth requires a password), so the error offers migration
alternatives instead - a basic block with a password placeholder, or a bearer block if
the username was really a token.

### Breaking: zero-traffic status semantics changed

`/internal/status` no longer reports `"status": "critical"` on a fresh boot with all
endpoints healthy. With no proxy traffic, the system status derives from endpoint health
alone, `success_rate` reports `"N/A"`, and a new always-present boolean
`system.has_traffic` lets clients branch on the no-traffic state without parsing the
success-rate string. Previously a healthy fresh boot fell through a `< 90.0` success-rate
threshold and reported `critical`, which coupled with the dashboard produced a misleading
red status on first start.

### Breaking: endpoint `id` derivation changed

The `id` values surfaced on `/internal/status`, `/internal/status/endpoints`, and the
per-model `endpoint_ids` on `/internal/status/models` are now derived from the sanitised
URL (scheme+host+port+path) with positional disambiguation for siblings that share a
sanitised form. Credential rotation no longer changes the ID, because userinfo, query,
and fragment are stripped before hashing. **Bookmarked dashboard deep-links to a specific
endpoint row will change once after upgrading**, then stay stable for endpoints with a
distinct name or a distinct sanitised URL. IDs may change again if a sibling sharing the
same sanitised URL is later added or removed, because the shared `-N` suffix is positional
and gets renumbered (and the degenerate case of two endpoints sharing both name and
sanitised URL is not immune either). The IDs are base36 FNV-1a, identical across all three
status payloads for the same endpoint from the same repository snapshot.

### Breaking: endpoint `url` in status responses is now sanitised

The `url` field on `/internal/status` and `/internal/status/endpoints` now has userinfo,
query string, and fragment stripped before it is surfaced. (`/internal/status/models`
exposes no URL at all - only endpoint display names and `endpoint_ids`.) Previously this
field echoed the raw configured URL, which could include embedded credentials. Clients
that compared this field against the raw config value for identity should switch to the
`id` field, which is designed for that purpose.

### Added: weak ETags on status JSON

The three status JSON routes now emit a **weak** `ETag` of the form `W/"<base36>"` over
their stable fields. `If-None-Match` uses weak comparison, so clients that echo the
`ETag` verbatim are unaffected. Clients doing strong-only comparison should allow weak
matches. See [Conditional requests and compression](../api-reference/system.md#conditional-requests-and-compression)
for the full contract.

### Fixed: proxy access logging restored

Successful proxy requests log at `Info` again in the access log. A regression had
demoted them to `Debug`, which silently broke the "log all requests" expectation the
security practices document promises. Only `/internal/` GET/HEAD polling that returns
`2xx` or `304` stays at `Debug` so an open dashboard tab does not flood the log; 4xx,
5xx, and any non-GET/HEAD method under `/internal/` continue to log at `Info`.

### Added: unbuilt-dashboard warning at startup

A binary built without `make build-web` (e.g. via `go install` or a plain `go build`)
now logs a clear startup line and serves `503` at `/internal/ui/` with a body naming the
fix. Previously such a binary served a silent placeholder. See
[Development Setup: building the dashboard](../development/setup.md#optional-bun-135-for-the-admin-dashboard).

### Added: admin dashboard at `/internal/ui/`

A read-only, single-page dashboard is now embedded in the binary and served from the
same listener as the proxy: Overview (fleet status, success rate, latency, a live
requests-per-second sparkline), Endpoints (per-endpoint health, priority, latency,
model count), and Models (inventory grouped by family, with hosting endpoints). It
polls the existing `/internal/status*` JSON every 5-15 seconds with `ETag`/`304`
caching - no WebSocket, no push, and nothing in it changes state.

There is no authentication. Access is controlled entirely by the new `dashboard.access_policy`
config block (`allowed_cidrs` + `allowed_hosts`), which defaults to loopback-only. The
published Docker image ships with `allowed_cidrs` pre-widened to the RFC1918 ranges and
the listener bound to `0.0.0.0`, so `docker run -p 40114:40114 ghcr.io/thushan/olla:latest`
followed by opening `/internal/ui/` works with no config mount - and also means the
dashboard, and the container, are reachable from anyone else on the same LAN through that
published port. The access policy gates `/internal/ui/` only: the `/internal/status*`,
`/internal/health`, `/internal/metrics` and `/version` JSON it reads stay as reachable as
they already were, `allowed_cidrs` or not. Unifying that gap under one policy is tracked
in issue #214.

See [Admin Dashboard](../configuration/dashboard.md) for the full security model and
configuration reference.

### Added: native `GET /internal/metrics`

Prometheus-format metrics are now exposed directly, built from the same data as
`/internal/status` and `/internal/stats/models` - system status, per-endpoint health,
security counters, model usage and routing. No external exporter is required for core
proxy monitoring. Thanks to **@Puupuls** for the contribution. See
[System API](../api-reference/system.md) for the metric series.

### Fixed: circuit-breaker-open no longer blocks failover

A request that lands on an endpoint whose circuit breaker is open now fails over to the
next available endpoint instead of the request failing outright. The endpoint is removed
from that request's candidate list only; its persisted health is left untouched, because
an open breaker already reflects accumulated failure state and demoting health on top of
it is the proxy engine's job for genuine connectivity failures, not the retry path's.
Exhaustion errors now distinguish circuit-breaker-open counts from connection-failure
counts instead of conflating the two under one message.

### Breaking: strict routing now fails fast on an unroutable alias

A request for a `model_aliases` entry whose target model exists on no endpoint used to be
logged as rejected but still proxied to a compatible backend anyway, returning `200` from
the wrong model. It now returns `404`/`503` with `routing_action: rejected`, matching how
unknown models are already handled. One side effect: `/olla/proxy/` with zero healthy
endpoints now returns `503` instead of `502` - update any monitor keyed on that specific
status code.

### Breaking: `owned_by` in converted model listings may return the raw matched segment

The organisation-extraction logic used by the vLLM, vLLM-MLX, SGLang, llama.cpp, LMDeploy
and Lemonade converters is now shared. Alongside the existing `org/model` slash split, it
also recognises a hyphen-separated leading segment against a known-organisation list and
returns that segment verbatim - so a model ID like `Qwen2.5-7B` now yields `owned_by:
"Qwen2.5"` rather than falling through to the converter's generic default. Anything
parsing `owned_by` for exact organisation matching should treat it as a best-effort label,
not a canonical identifier.

### Fixed: `config/models.yaml` customisations are no longer silently discarded

The shipped `config/models.yaml` used `\d` inside double-quoted YAML scalars, which is not
a valid YAML escape - the file has never parsed, on any install. The failure was swallowed
and Olla silently fell back to embedded defaults, so any customisation (e.g. capability
tagging via `name_patterns`) had no effect and no diagnostic. The regex patterns are fixed
to single-quoted scalars, config loading now happens eagerly at boot rather than lazily on
first request, and a found-but-unparseable candidate logs a `WARN` with the path and YAML
error instead of failing silently.

### Added: `--validate-config` flag

Run `olla --validate-config` to check the configuration and provider profiles without
starting the server - a clear pass/warn/fail report with exit codes, useful in CI or
before a restart.

### Fixed: `logging.level` in config is now honoured

The `logging.level` config field was parsed but never applied to the runtime logger.
Precedence is `OLLA_LOGGING_LEVEL` env var, then config file, then default; an invalid
value now warns and falls back instead of being silently ignored.
